\title{calculate risk}
\usage{
estRisk(pcActiveCases, A, G, rounding = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{pcActiveCases}{Per capita active cases.}

\item{A}{Ascertainment bias (ratio of infections to cases)}

\item{G}{Event size for risk to be calculated for.}

\item{rounding}{Number of decimal places to round to. Default of 0.}
}
\value{
Returns the risk that one or more people at an event size G may be infectious given case prevalence and ascertainment bias parameters.
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage probability that one or more persons in a group, with size G, may be infectious given the underlying prevalence of disease.
}
\examples{
# estimated risk that one or more are infectious in a group of 100,
# when there are 50 active cases in population of 10,000 and cases
# are underascertained by a factor of 4.
estRisk(50 / 10000, 4, 100)
